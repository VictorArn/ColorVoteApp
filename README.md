# ColorVoteApp
Hello, my name is Victor Arnautu. I am a student at Faculty of Statistics, Cybernetics and computer science in the penultimate year. This is the Color Voting App that I did in the specialized practice internship at NetVoip
If you want to run the app, you can run it from VoteAppApplication. You have to install a specific fxml GUI related app to run the fxml files, as for me I have used Scene Builder.
